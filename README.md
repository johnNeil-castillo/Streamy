# Streamy

**A personal project that uses local storage for streaming**
I will update this and make a real database for deployment

### Packages Used
+ react
+ react-redux
+ Axios
+ flv.js
+ lodash
+ react-router-dom
+ redux -form
+ redux-thunk
+ node-media-server
+ json-server
+ oauth

## npm start the api, client, and rtmpserver
> Login in with google oauth
>> Create stream and enter the title and description and click the stream you've made
>>> Open Obs, click settings, click stream tab and place rtmp://localhost/live on server
>>>> Stream key is the id of the stream on the URL/streams/1

The local database has already a stream created so the next one is 2

## Stream will automatically record after configuring settings on obs and the stream is opened in the browser
